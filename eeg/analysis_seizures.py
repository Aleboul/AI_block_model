"""
Clustering and Visualization of EEG Data Using Extremal Correlation Analysis

This script performs clustering and visualization on EEG data from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database 
for patient 05 during seizure events, leveraging an AI-based extremal correlation block model. The model 
identifies clusters of dependent EEG channels by calibrating the clustering threshold using SECO 
(Structural Extremal Coefficient Objective) to avoid trivial solutions.

Key steps include:
1. Loading and preprocessing EEG data.
2. Computing extremal correlation and the chi matrix.
3. Calibrating clustering thresholds based on SECO values.
4. Visualizing the extremal correlation matrix and its block structure.
5. Providing spatial representation of EEG clusters on 2D scalp maps.

The outputs include time-series plots, SECO calibration results, extremal correlation block structures, 
and spatial representations, saved as PDF files.

Dependencies:
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, matplotlib.patheffects, mne, eco_alg
