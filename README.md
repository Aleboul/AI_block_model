Repository Description
This repository contains code and data for replicating experiments and analyses presented in the main paper and supplementary materials. The repository is organized into four main directories:

1. competitors
This directory contains Python code for conducting numerical experiments outlined in Section 4 of the main paper. The code covers algorithms and methodologies discussed for comparative analysis.

2. eeg
Here, you'll find data and Python scripts necessary for replicating the data analysis described in Section 5.1 of the paper. The directory includes datasets and analysis scripts specifically tailored for EEG data analysis.

3. river_europe
In this directory, you'll find datasets and Python scripts for performing the analysis described in Section 5.2 of the paper. The focus here is on river data from Europe, and the scripts are designed to reproduce the analytical procedures outlined in the paper.

4. simulation
The simulation directory encompasses code in both Python and R for executing numerical experiments proposed in Section B.1 of the supplementary materials. This section includes additional simulations beyond those discussed in the main paper, and the scripts provided here facilitate their execution.
