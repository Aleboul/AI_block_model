# Supplementary code for "High dimensional variable clustering based on maxima of a weakly dependent random process"

This repository contains implementation of the ECO algorithm described in "High dimensional variable clustering based on maxima of a weakly dependent random process" and codes for generating all figures and table therein. 

## File descriptions:

* `model_i_parmixing_m.py`, i = 1,2,3: generates results for Framework F1 for the corresponding experiments.
* `model_i_parmixing_k.py`, i = 1,2,3: generates results for Framework F2 for the corresponding experiments.
* `model_i_parmixing_alpha.py`, i = 1,2,3: generates results for Framework F3 for the corresponding experiments.
* `output`: contains csv files of results and script to produce Figures.
