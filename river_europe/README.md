# Study of extreme river discharges.

## Data Description

These data were provided by the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). EFAS primarily relies on a distributed hydrological model that operates on a grid-based system, focusing on extreme river basins. The model integrates various medium-range weather forecasts, including comprehensive sets from the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS). The dataset was generated by inputting gridded observational precipitation data, with a resolution of 5 x 5 km, into the LISFLOOD hydrological model across the EFAS domain. The temporal resolution utilized was a $24$-hour time step, covering a span over $50$ years.

For the calibration of the LISFLOOD within the EFAS framework, a total of $1137$ stations from $215$ different catchments across the Pan-European EFAS domain were used. From this list of stations with available coordinates, we extracted time-series data from the nearest cell where EFAS data were accessible. However, in this pre-processing step, stations from Albania had to be excluded as the extracted time series were identical for those stations. Additionally, calibration stations from Iceland and Israel were removed since they were located far outside the domain. As a result, we were left with $1123$ gauging stations, covering $10898$ observed days of river discharge between $1991$ and $2020$. The biweekly block maxima approach yielded $783$ observations.
